ðŸš¨ Script is still under develpoment. Expect this documentation to be completed soon.

# file2drive 
Inspired by the need to backup all installed fonts from my local drive into my OneDrive, I came up with file2drive. An experimental script that makes use of Shutil to enter a folder and push them into a backup folder seamlessly. 

*Tested On Windows 10 + Python 3.6* 

### Pending
- Directory Restructuring
- Completing Documentation
- Testing on MacOS and Linux

### Future Plans
- Supplementing CLI with a possible GUI. 
- Memory Optimization of the script.

Iâ€™m just trying to create daily utility tools using Python. If this made your life easier, you know what you can do. If you feel something could change or be better optimized, please critique and contribute to this project.
